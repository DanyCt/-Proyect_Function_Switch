## Repository Description
This repository contains a Java project that implements a console program with a menu of options using the `switch` structure. The program offers the following functionalities:
- Add two numbers.
- Read and display a text entered by the user.
- Calculate the cosine of a number.
  
## Programming Language
The project is developed in the programming language **Java**. The following libraries and packages are used:
- `java.util.Scanner` for data input via the console.
- `java.lang.Math` for mathematical functions.

## ScreenShots
Below are some screenshots of the program in operation:

Option a allows you to enter 2 numbers via the keyboard, which will give you the sum, all within a function.
